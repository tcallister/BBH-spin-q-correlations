Mock Population Study
=====================

As an end-to-end test for possible systematics, we perform a mock population study in which we draw events from a simulated population, run parameter estimation over these signals, and hierarchically infer the properties of the simulated parent population.
By design, our mock population has **no intrinsic correlations** between mass ratios and spin; accordingly, we correctly find no correlations between the :math:`\chi_\mathrm{eff}` and :math:`q` distributions of the parent population.
